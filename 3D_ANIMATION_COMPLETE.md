# ✅ 3D Background Scroll Animation - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

I've successfully created an **advanced 3D background scroll animation** using your image (`nano-edit-1764669803143.png`) with stunning visual effects!

---

## 🎨 Features Added

### ✨ **Multi-Layer Parallax Background**
- Your image is displayed across **5 depth layers**
- Each layer moves at different speeds as you scroll
- Creates convincing 3D depth effect
- Responds to mouse movement for interactive tilt

### 🔷 **Floating 3D Geometric Shapes**
- **8 golden geometric objects** floating in 3D space
- Includes: icosahedrons, octahedrons, tetrahedrons, dodecahedrons, spheres, torus
- Metallic materials with glowing emissive effects
- Continuous rotation and organic floating motion
- Move toward camera as you scroll down

### ✨ **Advanced Particle System**
- **6,000 particles** across 3 layers
- Golden color palette matching restaurant theme
- Glowing additive blending effects
- Particles respond to scroll velocity
- Creates atmospheric depth and ambiance

### 💡 **Dynamic Cinematic Lighting**
- Ambient base lighting
- Main directional light with shadows
- 2 orbiting accent lights in golden colors
- Pulsing intensity for dramatic effect
- Lights follow time-based animations

### 📜 **Scroll Interactions**
All elements respond beautifully to page scroll:
- ✅ Background layers parallax at different speeds
- ✅ Geometric shapes move toward camera
- ✅ Particles flow with scroll velocity
- ✅ Camera zooms in progressively
- ✅ Layer opacity fades smoothly

### 🖱️ **Mouse Interactions**
- ✅ Camera follows mouse position
- ✅ Background layers tilt based on cursor
- ✅ Shapes respond to mouse movement
- ✅ Smooth easing for natural feel

scrollProgress = window.scrollY / maxScroll
// 0 = top of page
// 1 = bottom of page
```
- Everything responds to scroll position
- Smooth, cinematic transitions
- No jarring movements

### Performance Optimized
- Capped pixel ratio for mobile
- Efficient particle system
- Proper resource cleanup
- Smooth 60 FPS animation
